> Crafted collaboratively by a passionate team, the Pure Earth Preservation Portal is a testament to the harmonious blend of technology and environmental preservation. As our senior project, this platform is powered by the MERN stack and aims to be a nexus for conservation efforts. From interactive Q&As via ChatGPT, facilitating donations with Stripe, to housing an archive of Louisiana's national parks, we are dedicated to crafting a more informed and greener tomorrow.
